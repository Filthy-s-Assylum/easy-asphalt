  - Action: Configure API keys in .env for production

- [x] **Email Service**: Replace console logging with production email provider
  - Location: `server/services/email.ts`
  - Current: Resend API integration implemented (lines 143-185)
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED - Production email service with Resend
  - Action: Configure RESEND_API_KEY and EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS in .env

- [x] **Geolocation**: Implement proper reverse geocoding
  - Location: `server/services/geolocation.ts`
  - Current: Google Maps API + Zippopotam.us fallback (lines 10-93)
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED - Dual API integration with fallback
  - Action: Configure GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY in .env

### Frontend Enhancements

- [ ] **Mobile Touch Support**: Add full touch/pointer events for corner dragging
  - Location: `client/src/pages/Estimator.tsx` lines 595-619
  - Current: Uses pointer events but may not work correctly on all touch devices
